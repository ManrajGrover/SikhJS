Gurbani
==
Modern Gurbani application for Windows, OSX and Linux. Built on Electron.

Why ?
==
Well I'm a Sikh and I happen to be a web developer, so I saw an opportunity to use my skills to serve to my fellow Sikh brothers and Sisters.
Apart from that, the main reason behind the project is that the Baani softwares are of 1990s era in 2015s.
They are in dire neeed of a revamp, and this I believe is the first step towards a modern revolution for Sikhism, when youth uses technology to
learn more about Baani and Sikhism.

How ?
==
The application is very simple as of now. I've manually taken docs from [SikhNet] (http://www.sikhnet.com/DownloadBanis) 
and converted them to markdown files. The reason why I chose them is because they are 
  * very lightweight
  * can be parsed to HTML very easily
  * is pretty widely supported

A CSS class `gurbani-text` is used to use proper [Gurmukhi Fonts] (/fonts/) for text having Gurbani.
