Gurbani
==
Modern Gurbani application for Windows, OSX and Linux. Built on Electron.

Why ?
==
Well I'm a Sikh and I happen to be a web developer, so I saw an opportunity to use my skills to serve to my fellow Sikh brothers and Sisters.
Apart from that, the main reason behind the project is that the Baani softwares are of 1990s era in 2015s.
They are in dire neeed of a revamp, and this I believe is the first step towards a modern revolution for Sikhism, when youth uses technology to
learn more about Baani and Sikhism.
